{- | Predicate re-exports using operators.

We stick with non-operators for base predicate definitions because, very simply,
there aren't enough symbols to go around. The operators we would want to use for
logical predicates are already being used on the term level, and I forsee a
future full of promoted functions, so I wouldn't want to take up the type-level
name.

Instead, I'm providing operators in separate modules. It's not ideal, because
predicates already have operators defined in their pretty printing, and they may
not coincide with available Haskell symbols. I'm not really sure how to do all
this, it's very tentative for now.
